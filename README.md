Welcome to my personal portfolio website â€” a space to showcase who I am, what Iâ€™ve built, and how to get in touch. I created this site using **React** as a way to both learn and grow as a developer, while also sharing my work in one place.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **About Me** section  
- **Projects** page with links and descriptions  
- **Resume** download  
- **Contact** info  

Fully responsive and designed to look good on all screen sizes.
